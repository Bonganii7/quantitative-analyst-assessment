## Assessment on Question 1

The store has just under 200 active customers managing almost 600 terrariums. On average, each terrarium holds about 9 insects, which suggests the overall density is reasonable and operationally manageable.

Most customers sit in the medium ownership range (11�30 insects), meaning the store mainly serves regular hobbyists rather than one-time or very small buyers. At the same time, the 64 larger owners are important, as they are likely responsible for a significant portion of the total food demand.

Overall, the business structure looks steady, with consistent daily feeding requirements and a fairly balanced mix of small, medium and large customers.
